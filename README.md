### Description

This example adds a menu to IE when you right click on a webpage to download links just as DAP does and lists all the files in a listview control.

You can use this code to add to your own download accelerators. This example does download files but

Does not support resume as this was only an example

I have also included a Readme text file to show you how to get the project working.
