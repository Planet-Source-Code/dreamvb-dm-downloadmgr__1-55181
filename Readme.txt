This example adds a menu to IE when you right clock on a webpage to download links just as DAP does.
You can use this code to add to your own download accelerators. This example does download files but
Does not support resume as this was only an example to show you how to add it to your own projects.

Ok to install 

1. open the Download.vbp in the DLL folder.
2. Compile Download.vbp to the install folder provided with this example.
3. Open the project Install.vbp in the install folder and Click Install button.

That's it the installer will install the two files Download.dll and dload.html to your chosen install path
this will also register the download.dll and add the information to the registry required to run the example.

Ok if you want to remove it latter here are the places to delete the info form the registry

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\MenuExt\&Download Links with DM Tiny Downloader Manager

and delete the key &Download Links with DM Tiny Downloader Manager.

Well I hope you like this example please vote.
